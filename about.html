                <div class="bio">
                    <p>I’m a born and raised Las Vegas native. Had the opportunity to live in Oceanside, California for about 6 years before moving back to Las Vegas. My name comes from a road outside of Baker, California. Parents thought it was cool so they named me after it. I’ve been passionate about art and design since I was young and want to make a career out of it. Other things that I’m passionate about is being with my Husky dog, Dusty, and learning different skills through Udemy. Skills centered around drawing, writing, and game design.</p>

                       <h2>Where The Name Came From</h2>
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <p style="text-indent: 20px">My family were driving down Bakers, California, when they noticed a road that said, "Zzyzx Rd". They thought it was cool and unique and decided on naming me after it. My parents didn't know how to pernounce the name till they heard it over the radio as "z-i-zik" (like isaic with a Z). Growing up with the name has been interesting and certainly has made me stand out more than others.</p>
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <p style="text-indent: 20px">The real story behind the name is a bit interesting. Everyone knows of the road while passing by, but not a lot of people know where the road leads to and the story behind it. If you exit on Zzyzx Rd, it would take you to an old health spa location. There you would find a plaque the tells a story of a man who built the health spa and named it "Zzyzx" meaning "last place on earth". When you get a chance I recommend going down there at least once.</p>
